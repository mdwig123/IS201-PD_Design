        <p class="justify"><span class="bold">Mission Statement:</span>My goal is to become an accountant at a firm. Learn as much as possible from the expierences I'll be able to have there. 
            Then take what I have learned along with my Wife, and together make our own buisness. Which, thanks to this class I can now get a head start on creating her an Amazing website which
